        <h4 className="my-4">Hello Ordino! üëã</h4>

        <p>
          With this release we provide a dedicated homepage for Ordino to welcome new and recurring users.
          The modern pages provide an overview of the Ordino features, loaded datasets, and publications.
          We also inform about the most recent changes and developments on this page.
        </p>

        <img className="img-fluid mb-4" src={v900_homepage} alt="The new Ordino Hompage welcomes its user." />

        <p>
          The application itself was moved to the <a href="./app" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><code>/app</code> directory</a>.
          Please update your bookmarks if you want to access Ordino directly and to skip the homepage.
        </p>


        <h4 className="my-4">Start menu overhaul</h4>

        <p>
          In addition to the new homepage we designed an entirely new Ordino start menu.
          The new start menu is divided into three main tabs: datasets, sessions, and tours.
          Each tab has now more space and is structured into different sections to select or upload datasets,
          save a session, or start a tour.
        </p>


        <img className="img-fluid mb-4" src={v900_start_menu} alt="The new Ordino start menu." />

        <p>
          From an analysis you can now directly access these tab from the application header.
        </p>

        <img className="img-fluid mb-4" src={v900_start_menu_tabs} alt="Access the start menu tabs from the application header in your analysis." />


        <p>
          In case you need help or want give feedback or report a bug, click on the ?-icon in the application header.
        </p>

        <img className="img-fluid mb-4" src={v900_application_help} alt="Ordino at a glance integrated in the application." />

        <h4 className="my-4">A new look</h4>

        <p>
          We have improved the design and usability of the whole application in general
          and the ranking views in specific to make the usage easier and more appealing.
        </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">New data</h4>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Gene Signature Scores</h5>

        <p>
          <i>Gene Signature Scores</i> are now available for cell lines and tissue samples (including GTEx, TCGA, and PDX models). These can be added using the <i>Add Column</i> dialog:

          This update contains more <b>data</b>, many <b>new features</b>, various <b>improvements</b>, and a large number of <b>bug fixes</b>. The most important changes are:
      </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">New data</h4>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Database</h5>
        <p>
          All data has be been updated from hg19 to hg38!
            </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4">HLA-A type, Mutational Burden and MSI Status</h5>
        <p>
          Now, HLA-A type, Mutational Burden and MSI Status data is available for many cell line and tissue samples.<br />
        </p>
        <p>
          <i> How to access</i>: Open a list of cell lines 	&#8594; click on ‚Äú+‚Äù to open the ‚Äúadd column‚Äù dialog 	&#8594; select "Annotation Columns" 	&#8594; select the data of interest.
        </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">Completely new features</h4>
        <h5 className="mt-4">Basic statistical analyses</h5>
        <img className="img-fluid mb-2" src={v700_tourdino} alt="Tourdino" />
        <p>
          It is now possible to do basic statistical analyses, like calculating the correlation of two columns, directly in Ordino.
      </p>
        <p>
          <i>How to access</i>: Click on the calculator icon on the right. This opens a new side-panel (highlighted in red in the screenshot above).<br /> There you can select which columns to compare and then get detailed information about the result.
      </p>

        <h4 className="my-4">Improved features</h4>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Improved column operations (filtering, sorting, etc)</h5>
        <p>
          <i>How to access</i>: click on any of the icons in the column headers.
            </p>
        <p>
          The column dialogs were harmonized.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is now a live preview. For instance, if you modify the filter setting of a column, you can see in the background how this will affect your list of genes, cell lines, and tissue samples.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is now possible to reset all filters at once in the right side-panel. <i>Access side-panel by clicking on the left-facing arrow in the menu on the right</i>.
        </p>

        <p>
          The grouping of text columns (like mutations) is now working much better (e.g., allowing you to split your cell lines by specific mutations). <i>How to access: click the ‚Äú‚Ä¶‚Äù in the column header and then select ‚ÄúGroup By‚Äù</i>.
      </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Interactive help tours</h5>
        <p>
          To make it easier for new users to get to know Ordino, we also added two additional interactive help tours that guide you through the application.
            </p>
        <p>
          <i>These can be accessed by clicking on the ‚Äú?‚Äù in the upper right corner of Ordino</i>.
      </p>

        <h5 className="mt-4">Briefly noted</h5>

        <p>
          Improved look and feel of the list of cell lines, genes, and tissue samples.
         </p>
        <p>
          Collapsing and expanding of sample / gene groups is now recorded in the session history.
         </p>
        <p>
          The columns "AA mutated" and "DNA mutated" have been harmonized. There is now no category "Unknown" anymore, but missing values are handled the same way as in all other columns.
         </p>
        <p>
          File upload has been improved and now supports boolean (i.e., true/false) columns.
